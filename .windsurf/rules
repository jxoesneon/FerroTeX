# FerroTeX Workspace Rules (Windsurf)

## Governance
- Work trunk-based: all changes go through PRs; do not assume direct pushes to main.
- Keep CI green: run lint/tests locally before commits when feasible.

## Tooling / Automation
- Prefer GitHub MCP tooling for GitHub operations (labels, milestones, PRs, releases). Use gh CLI only if MCP is unavailable.
- When adding CI workflows, prefer deterministic pinned action versions and fail-fast checks.

## Quality Gates
- Before tagging a release, ensure:
  - markdown lint passes
  - yaml lint passes
  - link check passes
  - TeX Live smoke build passes

## Documentation Site
- GitHub Pages uses Jekyll; treat docs/ as the canonical source.
- Keep docs changes reviewable and avoid mass rewrites unless required for publishing.
