# Governance

This document defines the current governance model for FerroTeX.

## Current Stage

FerroTeX is currently maintained as an early-stage project.

- **Maintainer:** Jose Eduardo Rojas Jimenez
- **Decision style:** maintainer-led, with ADRs for significant changes

## Decision Making

- Minor changes: maintainers decide during code review.
- Major changes (public API, IR schema, parser invariants, protocol behavior):
  - discussed via an issue
  - recorded via an ADR in `docs/adrs/`

## Becoming a Maintainer

As the project grows, contributors may be invited to maintainership based on:

- sustained, high-quality contributions
- demonstrated alignment with project values
- ability to review and mentor

## Conflicts of Interest

Any maintainer with a conflict of interest on a decision should disclose it in the issue/ADR.
